            <h2>Welcome!</h2>

            <p>This site was created for brand new soldiers — the ones just stepping into the Army and 
                trying to figure things out. When I first joined, I found it tough to track down 
                all the important information I needed in one place, so I decided to build the resource 
                I wish I had. My goal is to make it easier for new soldiers to find the answers, guidance,
                and tools they need to succeed early in their careers. I’m currently a PFC with about a 
                year and a half in service, and I’m still learning — both as a soldier and as a web developer. 
                This website is a work in progress, and I’m constantly updating it as I learn more and 
                improve my skills. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope what you find here helps make your 
                journey a little smoother.
