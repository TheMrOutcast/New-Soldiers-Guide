        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>This site was created for brand new soldiers — the ones just stepping into the Army and trying to figure things out.<br />
            When I first joined, I found it tough to track down all the important information I needed in one place,<br />
            so I decided to build the resource I wish I had. My goal is to make it easier for new soldiers to find the answers, guidance,<br />
            and tools they need to succeed early in their careers. I’m currently a PFC with about a year and a half in service,<br />
            and I’m still learning — both as a soldier and as a web developer. This website is a work in progress, and I’m constantly<br />
            updating it as I learn more and improve my skills. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope what you<br />
            find here helps make your journey a little smoother.</p>
