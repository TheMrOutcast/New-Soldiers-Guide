        <h3>What is SHARP?</h3>
            <p>In the U.S. Army, SHARP stands for Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention.<br />
            It is the Army’s program to prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault while providing<br />
            support to victims and ensuring accountability for perpetrators. The program focuses on<br />
            prevention through training and awareness, response by offering confidential reporting<br />
            and victim advocacy, and accountability through investigations and appropriate<br />
            disciplinary action. Key personnel include SHARP Program Managers, Victim Advocates,<br />
            and Unit SHARP Representatives, all of whom help implement policies and provide guidance.</p>
