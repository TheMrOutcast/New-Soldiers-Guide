        <br />

        <h3>What is "Equal Opportunity"?</h3>
        <p>Equal Opportunity, also known as EO, is a program designed to ensure fair<br />
            and equitable treatment for all soldiers, civilians, and family members<br />
            regardless of race, color, gender, religion, national origin,<br />
            or sexual orientation. Governed by Army Regulation 600-20 (Chapter 6),<br />
            the EO program promotes an environment free from discrimination<br />
            and harassment. Each unit has EO Advisors and EO Leaders who assist<br />
            commanders by providing guidance, conducting training, and addressing complaints.</p>
