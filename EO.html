            <h2>Military Equal Opportunity (MEO)</h2>

            <h3>What is "Military Equal Opportunity"?</h3>
            <p>The MEO Program formulates, directs, and sustains a comprehensive effort to maximize human potential and
               to ensure fair treatment for all Soldiers based solely on merit, performance, and potential in support of readiness. MEO
               philosophy is based on fairness and justice. Commanders are responsible for sustaining a positive EO climate within
               their units.
               <br />
               The Army will provide an environment that is free of unlawful discrimination. Discrimination occurs when
               someone, or a group of people, is harassed, intimidated, insulted, humiliated, or is treated less favorably than another
               person or group, because of their race, color, sex , national origin, religion, or sexual orientation. It includes use of
               disparaging terms with respect to a person’s race, color, sex , national origin, religion, or sexual orientation which
               contributes to a hostile work environment.
