        <h2>ARMY Regulations (AR's)</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>What is a ARMY Regulation?</h3>
        <p>An ARMY Regulation (AR for short), is an official directive published by<br />
            the Department of the Army that sets policies, responsibilities,<br />
            and procedures for how the Army operates. They are legally binding<br />
            for Soldiers and Army civilians — meaning you’re required to follow<br />
            them just like lawful orders.</p>

        <p>Below is a list of AR's that are probably the most important for you to know as someone<br />
            getting ready to leave for basic, getting to AIT, or your first duty station.</p>
