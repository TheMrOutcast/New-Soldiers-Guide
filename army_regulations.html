            <h2>ARMY Regulations (AR's)</h2>

        
            <h3>What is a ARMY Regulation?</h3>
            <p>An ARMY Regulation (AR for short), is an official directive published by
            the Department of the Army that sets policies, responsibilities,
            and procedures for how the Army operates. They are legally binding
            for Soldiers and Army civilians — meaning you’re required to follow
            them just like lawful orders.
            </p>

            <p>Below is a list of AR's that are probably the most important for you to know as someone
            getting ready to leave for basic, getting to AIT, or your first duty station.
